# Audio-Sampling-Filtering <br>

## Overview <br>
This is my course project on filtering and sampling of rcored audio signals using iscrete fourier transform (as part of my course Signals and Systems) under the mentorship of Proff. Rajendra Nagar at IIT Jodhpur in partnership with one of my batchmates. <br>
The main reason for uploading this project is that it is a very unique project that can help us in filtering,smapling , removing any unwanted noises from our audio signals as well as can be used to take reference to make projects like this for any other form of signals as well and help us in improving them for better use. <br>

## Objective (Goal of this project)âž– <br>
1. Record Voice Signals of each group member speaking given 4
sentences. <br>
2. Sample the Recorded Signals on given 3 Sampling Frequencies. <br>
3. Filter out unwanted/unnecessary sound from nearby sources by
proposing and implementing an algorithm to filter out sampled
signals. <br>
4. Find all frequencies or x[n] of final recordings using Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) X(f) by implementing formulas studied in class. <br>
5. Plot | X(f) | for all different frequencies present in the signal. <br>
6. Clearly label the x-axis and the y-axis with proper range of
magnitude and frequency. <br>
7. Analyze the frequencies present in all the recordings as you vary
across sentences, group members and sampling rates. <br>
8. Report your interesting findings. <br>
